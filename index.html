                    There used to be a time when the American dollar would exchange for about a 100 Kwacha in the 2000s,
                    now that is a long gone day dream. A lot of factors have contributed to this devaluation but in the 
                    background, the real cause is the 80-20 percent effect. Instead of political figures taking 20% and 
                    giving back 80%, they are doing the opposite. On-top of that, the world itself is in a critical state with 
                    environmental adjustment that are causing devastating recurring events to occur.

                    How it looks, feels and works has drastically evolved!.
                    From two used tin cans connected with a string to a pair
                    of goggles attached to your head, the mobile phone has 
                    come a long way and has changed as much as humanity has.
                    As we shift from slab phones with 6 inch displays to foldable
                    and virtual reality headsets. The world of artificial intelligence
                    threatens to wipe its existence by taking its place and projecting 
                    an interface on a surface with a thumb sized device. I am simply 
                    talking out of speculation here but the evidence points in the direction 
                    of the future in tech. All these prototypes that we are being introduced to
                    are somewhat being pulled out of sci-fi movies and in a few we will most likely 
                    have flying cars that we can entirely rely on.
